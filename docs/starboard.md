?> After you make a Starboard channel, your members can react to any message with a ⭐ `:star:` which counts as a vote to display that message as a post on the Starboard. Once the message gets enough reactions *(default are 6)*, Manacord posts it onto the Starboard. By default, a user's reaction on their own post doesn't count.
